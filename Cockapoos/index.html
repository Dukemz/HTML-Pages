<h1>Cockapoos
</h1>
<p>The Cockapoo is a breed of dog. While uncommon, they are far from rare</p> 
<p>as they are ideal for most roles of the domesticated dog. As their name</p> 
<p>suggests, they are bred from Cocker Spaniels and Poodles. This means that</p> 
<p>they have many positives in their traits.</p>

<h1>Appearance
</h1>
<p> With this breed of dog, appearance varies quite largely, so this is merely a general description of what common Cockapoos look like. Most Cockapoos have one or two colors of fur, and have irregular patterns on it. As Poodles and Cocker Spaniels differ in many ways in appearance, genetics clash. I have a Cockapoo	that has soft, curly Poodle fur in places, and wirey Spaniel fur in others!

<h1>Behaviour
</h1>
<p> Cockerpoos are normally sociable and approach other dogs and humans happily and excitedly. Keep in mind that they will always express a great level of celebration when meeting someone they recognise. They seem to have bags of energy when they want to, and none when they don't. They are quite needy and they spend a lot of time and effort trying to make sure they have the final say. While they are intelligent, they are mischievious and while some dogs put their brain power to following your every command, they put it to learning and planning the best means of escape!
