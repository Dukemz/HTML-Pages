<font size="5"><p><em>Swimming is a tough, individual sport. For swimming, there are the 2 T's (technique, turns) 
and the 3 S' (speed, strength, stamina), remember that when doing swimming and practise 
in that order. That is the most helpful tip, but I will go through all other strokes 
individually and give you the best advice ever.</em></p></font>
<p> </p>

<h3><u>Front Crawl</u></h3>

 <font size="4"><p>Front Crawl (also known as freestyle) is the main stroke in swimming, so you 
have to be the best at it. I will number each piece of advice.</p>

<p>1) <b>3-stroke-breathe,</b> this means on every third stroke you do, you breathe to the side. This 
is because of the fact that if you only breathe to one side, your body will be unbalanced
which will hinder your stroke.</p>

<p>2) <b>Breathe low,</b> no matter how much you need to breathe, turn your head to the side until
your mouth is <strong>halfway</strong> above the surface of the water and breathe. The higher your head goes,
the less of a streamline you have and the slower you go.</p>

<p>3) <b>Stretch your arm,</b> stretch it as far as it can go <strong>through</strong> the water. The 
further your arm goes, the more pull you have on the stroke.</p></font>
<p> </p>

<h3><u>Backstroke</u></h3>

 <font size="4"><p>Backstroke is front crawl, but on your back.</p>

<p>1) <b>Keep your head still,</b> if you move your head, your streamline will be lost, your stroke will
 be off-centre and you will get <strong>disqualified.</strong></p>

<p>2) <b>Count your srokes,</b> there is a reason why there are flags above the pool and that's because 
of backstroke. If you count the strokes when going past the flags until you reach the wall, you know how 
many strokes it takes so you don't have to look. If you subtract one stroke from that, that's how many 
strokes you need to do before a turn.</p> 

<p>3) <b>Windmill arms,</b> literally. Turn your arms in a dual windmill shape whilst <strong>rolling</strong> 
your shoulders. Don't have your arms in line with the centre of your body, have them in line with your ears.</p>
<p></p></font>

<h3><u>Breaststroke</u></h3>
<img src="breast.jfif" width="300" align="right" />
<font size="4"><p>Breaststroke is the stroke the most people get disqualified on.</p>

<p>1) <b>Be symmetrical,</b> keep your left side of the your body the same as your right. Your arms should move
in a synchronised fashion with your legs. Screw kick is the worst, this is when one of your legs bend inwards
and turn like a screw (hence the name).</p>

<p>2) <b>Stay streamline,</b> keep your body straight and not arched. When breathing, breathe just above the water
so your body is still relatively in a streamline position.</p>

<p>3) <b>Proper streamline,</b> when you push off from the wall or when you dive, streamline. Stretch
 your arms out with one on top of the other. Wait 2-3 seconds and then do ONE butterfly kick. After 2 seconds 
do an arm pull down to your hips. Then do a full stroke and you should be at the surface. For an example on 
how to do it, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONbhH8l5HX0">here.</a></p>
<p> </p>

<h3><u>Butterfly</u></h3>
<img src="butterfly.jfif" width="300" align="right" />
 <font size="4"><p>Butterfly is said to be the hardest stroke, but also one of the easiest.<p>

<p>1) <b>Be quick,</b> the quicker you are at butterfly the easier it is. That's because your 
arms have to pull through and launch over your head. If there is no hesitation in pulling your arms through the 
water, there is more momentum in throwing your arms over, making it easier.

<p>2) <b>Be a butterfly,</b> stay symmetrical just like breaststroke. A butterfly has the same pattern on
 either wing so that's why the stroke is called butterfly.</p>
 
<p>3) <b>Stay low,</b> skim the water when breathing and keep your body streamline, a wobbly body is a wobbly 
stroke which is a bad stroke.</p></font>
